# ✅ Electron + Bazel Integration Complete!

## Success! Graham Jenson's Approach Implemented

Your Gazel application now runs as an Electron desktop app through Bazel, following the approach from Graham Jenson's bazel-electron repository.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. **Custom Bazel Rule** (`electron.bzl`)
- Downloads Electron binary directly from GitHub releases
- Bundles your app files into the Electron binary
- Creates a self-contained macOS application

### 2. **Python Bundler** (`electron-app/bundler.py`)
- Extracts the Electron binary
- Adds your app files to `Contents/Resources/app/`
- Sets proper execute permissions
- Creates a tar archive of the complete app

### 3. **Simple CommonJS Main** (`electron-app/main.js`)
- Uses CommonJS (require) instead of ES modules
- Loads either Vite dev server or production build
- Handles window creation and app lifecycle

### 4. **Bazel BUILD Configuration** (`electron-app/BUILD.bazel`)
- Uses the custom `electron_app` rule
- Python binary for the bundler
- Clean integration with Bazel

## How to Use

### Run the Electron App
```bash
bazel run //electron-app:gazel-app
# or use the alias
bazel run //electron-app:run
```

### Build Without Running
```bash
bazel build //electron-app:gazel-app
# Output: bazel-bin/electron-app/gazel-app.tar
```

### Extract and Inspect
```bash
tar -xf bazel-bin/electron-app/gazel-app.tar
open Gazel.app
```

## Key Benefits

✅ **No npm in Bazel** - Avoids complex node_modules handling  
✅ **Self-contained** - Each build produces a complete Electron app  
✅ **Platform-specific** - Can target different platforms with different binaries  
✅ **Simple & Clean** - Follows Bazel best practices  
✅ **Reproducible** - Deterministic builds with fixed Electron versions  

## Architecture

```
MODULE.bazel
  └── Downloads Electron binary (http_file)
  
electron.bzl
  └── Defines electron_app rule
  
electron-app/
  ├── BUILD.bazel (uses electron_app rule)
  ├── bundler.py (packages the app)
  ├── main.js (Electron entry point)
  ├── index.html (app UI)
  └── run.sh.tpl (launch script template)
```

## Next Steps

### For Development
- Start dev server (without browser): `bazel run //app:dev_no_browser`
- Run Electron: `bazel run //electron:run`
- The Electron app will connect to localhost:5173

Note: Use `//app:dev` if you want to open in a web browser instead

### For Production
1. Build the client: `bazel build //client:build`
2. Update index.html to load built assets
3. Run: `bazel run //electron-app:run`

### Platform Support
Currently configured for macOS (Darwin ARM64/x64). To add other platforms:
1. Add more `http_file` entries in MODULE.bazel for Linux/Windows
2. Update `electron.bzl` to select the right binary based on platform
3. Adjust bundler.py for platform-specific packaging

## Comparison with Previous Attempts

| Approach | Status | Issues |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Electron Forge + Bazel | ❌ Failed | Sandbox conflicts, module resolution |
| Direct npm in Bazel | ❌ Complex | node_modules handling issues |
| **Graham's Approach** | ✅ **Working** | **Clean, simple, follows Bazel patterns** |

This implementation is based on:
- [Graham Jenson's bazel-electron](https://github.com/grahamjenson/bazel-electron)
- Article: ["Building an Electron App with Bazel"](https://maori.geek.nz/building-an-electron-app-with-bazel)

The approach has been adapted for your TypeScript/Svelte stack while maintaining the simplicity of the original design.
