# ✅ Migration from pnpm to Yarn - COMPLETE

**Date:** 2025-10-14

## Summary

The Gazel project has been successfully migrated from pnpm to Yarn. All configuration files, Bazel files, GitHub Actions workflows, and documentation have been updated.

## What Was Changed

### 1. Configuration Files ✅

- **`.npmrc`**: Updated to use yarn configuration
- **`package.json`**: 
  - Added `workspaces` field
  - Added `"private": true`
  - Removed `pnpm` configuration section
- **`pnpm-workspace.yaml`**: Deleted (replaced by workspaces in package.json)
- **`yarn.lock`**: Generated (325 KB, 948 packages)

### 2. Bazel Configuration ✅

- **`MODULE.bazel`**: Changed `pnpm_lock` to `yarn_lock`
- **`BUILD.bazel`**: Updated exports to reference `yarn.lock`
- **`app/BUILD.bazel`**: Updated comments

### 3. GitHub Actions Workflow ✅

- **`.github/workflows/build-macos.yml`**:
  - Removed pnpm installation step
  - Changed cache from 'pnpm' to 'yarn'
  - Updated install command to `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
  - Changed build commands to use `yarn` instead of `pnpm exec`

### 4. Documentation ✅

Updated all references from pnpm to yarn in:
- `QUICK_REFERENCE.md`
- `RENDERER_NOT_LOADING_FIX.md`
- `docs/electron-ipc-integration.md`
- `.github/WORKFLOW_FIXES.md`
- And others...

### 5. New Documentation ✅

- **`YARN_MIGRATION.md`**: Complete migration guide
- **`MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md`**: This file

## Files Modified

```

  .npmrc
  package.json
  MODULE.bazel
  BUILD.bazel
  app/BUILD.bazel
  .github/workflows/build-macos.yml
  .github/WORKFLOW_FIXES.md
  QUICK_REFERENCE.md

  server/pnpm-lock.yaml

Created:
  yarn.lock (325 KB)
  YARN_MIGRATION.md
  MIGRATION_COMPLETE.md
```

## Verification Steps

### ✅ 1. Dependencies Installed

```bash
$ yarn install
✓ 948 packages installed successfully
✓ yarn.lock generated (325 KB)
```

### ⏳ 2. Bazel Integration (Next Step)

You should verify Bazel can use the new yarn.lock:

```bash
# Clean Bazel cache
bazel clean --expunge

# Generate proto files
bazel build //proto:index

# Should complete successfully
```

### ⏳ 3. Build Test (Next Step)

Test the Electron build:

```bash
# Package the app
yarn package

# Should create out/Gazel-darwin-arm64/Gazel.app
```

### ⏳ 4. GitHub Actions (Next Step)

Push changes and verify the workflow runs successfully:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Migrate from pnpm to Yarn"
git push origin main

# Check GitHub Actions tab for build status
```

## Command Reference

| Old (pnpm) | New (yarn) |
|------------|------------|
| `pnpm install` | `yarn install` |
| `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` | `yarn install --frozen-lockfile` |
| `pnpm add <pkg>` | `yarn add <pkg>` |
| `pnpm add -D <pkg>` | `yarn add -D <pkg>` |
| `pnpm remove <pkg>` | `yarn remove <pkg>` |
| `pnpm start` | `yarn start` |
| `pnpm package` | `yarn package` |
| `pnpm make` | `yarn make` |
| `pnpm exec electron-forge package` | `yarn electron-forge package` |

## Benefits of This Migration

1. **Simpler CI/CD**: Yarn comes with Node.js, no separate installation needed
2. **Better Compatibility**: No need for `pnpm exec` workarounds with Electron Forge
3. **Mature Ecosystem**: Yarn has excellent tooling support
4. **Workspace Support**: Yarn workspaces are well-established
5. **Cleaner Configuration**: Single package.json for workspace config

## Known Issues

### Peer Dependency Warnings

Yarn reported some peer dependency warnings during installation:

```
⚠ @bufbuild/protoc-gen-es version mismatch
⚠ @connectrpc/connect version mismatch  
⚠ svelte version mismatch
⚠ lucide-svelte missing svelte peer dependency
```

**Status**: These are warnings, not errors. The project should still work correctly. These can be addressed in a future update if needed.

## Next Steps

1. **Test Bazel Integration**:
   ```bash
   bazel clean --expunge
   bazel build //proto:index
   ```

2. **Test Local Build**:
   ```bash
   yarn package
   ```

3. **Commit Changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Migrate from pnpm to Yarn
   
   - Replace pnpm-workspace.yaml with workspaces in package.json
   - Update .npmrc for yarn configuration
   - Update MODULE.bazel to use yarn.lock
   - Update GitHub Actions workflow
   - Update all documentation
   - Generate yarn.lock with 948 packages"
   
   git push origin main
   ```

4. **Monitor GitHub Actions**:
   - Check that the workflow runs successfully
   - Verify signed builds work correctly

5. **Update Team**:
   - Notify team members about the migration
   - Share YARN_MIGRATION.md for migration instructions
   - Update any local aliases (e.g., `alias yarn=pnpm` should be removed)

## Rollback Plan

If you need to rollback to pnpm:

1. Restore `pnpm-workspace.yaml`
2. Restore pnpm config in `package.json`
3. Update `.npmrc` back to pnpm settings
4. Update `MODULE.bazel` to use `pnpm_lock`
5. Run `pnpm install`

However, the yarn migration should work better for this project.

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check `YARN_MIGRATION.md` for detailed migration guide
2. Check troubleshooting section in YARN_MIGRATION.md
3. Verify you're using real yarn, not an alias to pnpm
4. Open an issue if problems persist
