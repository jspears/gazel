# Bazel workspace configuration
# BAZEL_WORKSPACE is now managed by the client and stored in localStorage
# The server keeps the workspace in memory only and doesn't persist it
# You can optionally set an initial workspace here for development
# BAZEL_WORKSPACE=/path/to/your/bazel/workspace

# Optional: Server port configuration (defaults to 3001)
# PORT=3001
