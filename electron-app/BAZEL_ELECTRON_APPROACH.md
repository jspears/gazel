# Bazel Electron Integration Approach

Based on Graham Jenson's bazel-electron repository, here's the approach for integrating Electron with Bazel:

## Key Concepts

1. **Download Electron Binary**: Use `http_file` to download the Electron binary directly
2. **Bundle Tool**: Create a tool that packages your app files into the Electron binary
3. **Custom Rule**: Define a Bazel rule that orchestrates the bundling process
4. **Run Script**: Generate a script that extracts and runs the bundled app

## Implementation Steps

### 1. WORKSPACE Configuration
- Download Electron binary as an `http_file`
- No need for npm dependencies in Bazel

### 2. Custom Electron Rule
- Takes your app files (main.js, index.html, etc.) as inputs
- Bundles them into the Electron binary structure
- Outputs a tar archive of the complete app

### 3. Bundle Tool
- Extracts the Electron binary
- Adds your app files to `Contents/Resources/app/`
- Creates a package.json if needed
- Re-packages everything as a tar archive

### 4. Run Script
- Extracts the tar archive to a temp directory
- Launches the Electron app
- Cleans up on exit

## Benefits

- **No npm in Bazel**: Avoids complex node_modules handling in Bazel
- **Self-contained**: Each build produces a complete Electron app
- **Platform-specific**: Can download different Electron binaries per platform
- **Simple**: No need to deal with Electron Forge or complex build tools

## Differences from Current Approach

Instead of trying to make Electron Forge work within Bazel's sandbox, this approach:
- Downloads a pre-built Electron binary
- Simply copies your app files into it
- Produces a runnable application bundle

This is much simpler and more aligned with how Bazel is designed to work.
