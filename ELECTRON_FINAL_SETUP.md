# 🎉 Electron + Bazel Integration Complete!

## Quick Start

### Running Gazel as an Electron Desktop App

1. **Start the development server (without browser):**
   ```bash
   bazel run //app:dev_no_browser
   ```

2. **Launch the Electron app:**
   ```bash
   bazel run //electron-app:gazel-app
   ```

That's it! The Electron app will automatically detect the dev server and load Gazel.

## What Was Implemented

### ✅ Graham Jenson's Approach
Following the article "Building an Electron App with Bazel", we implemented:

1. **Direct Electron Binary Download**
   - Downloads Electron from GitHub releases
   - No npm dependencies in Bazel
   - Clean, hermetic builds

2. **Custom Python Bundler**
   - Preserves symlinks using system `unzip`
   - Sets proper execute permissions
   - Creates self-contained app bundles

3. **Smart Index Page**
   - Auto-detects dev server
   - Shows helpful instructions when server is down
   - Beautiful gradient UI while loading

4. **No Browser Launch**
   - Created `//app:dev_no_browser` target
   - Prevents browser from opening when running in Electron
   - Uses environment variable detection

## Available Commands

### For Web Development (Browser)
```bash
bazel run //app:dev          # Opens in browser automatically
```

### For Electron Development (Desktop)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start dev server without browser
bazel run //app:dev_no_browser

# Terminal 2: Launch Electron app
bazel run //electron-app:gazel-app
```

### Build Only (No Launch)
```bash
bazel build //electron-app:gazel-app
# Output: bazel-bin/electron-app/gazel-app.tar
```

## Architecture

```
gazel/
├── MODULE.bazel              # Downloads Electron binaries
├── electron.bzl              # Custom Bazel rule for Electron
├── electron-app/
│   ├── BUILD.bazel          # Uses electron_app rule
│   ├── bundler.py           # Packages app into Electron
│   ├── main.js              # Electron entry point
│   ├── index.html           # Smart loading page
│   └── run.sh.tpl           # Launch script template
└── app/
    └── BUILD.bazel          # Contains dev_no_browser target
```

## Key Features

### 🚀 Clean Separation
- Bazel handles the build
- No npm/node_modules complexity in Bazel
- Electron runs as a standalone desktop app

### 🎯 Smart Detection
- Auto-detects if dev server is running
- Shows instructions if server is down
- Retries connection every 5 seconds

### 🛠️ Developer Experience
- No browser opens when using Electron
- Clear error messages and instructions
- Beautiful UI while loading

## Troubleshooting

### If Electron shows blank page:
1. Check if dev server is running: `bazel run //app:dev_no_browser`
2. Wait for "VITE v5.4.20 ready" message
3. Refresh Electron app (Cmd+R)

### If Electron crashes on launch:
- Make sure you've run `bazel clean` after any BUILD file changes
- Check that the Electron binary downloaded correctly

### To see console output:
- Open DevTools in Electron: View → Toggle Developer Tools

## Next Steps

### For Production
1. Build client for production: `bazel build //client:build`
2. Update `index.html` to load built assets instead of dev server
3. Create installer with `electron-builder` or similar

### Platform Support
Currently supports macOS (ARM64 and x64). To add other platforms:
1. Add Linux/Windows binaries to MODULE.bazel
2. Update `electron.bzl` to select correct binary
3. Adjust `bundler.py` for platform-specific packaging

## Summary

✅ **Electron app runs through Bazel**  
✅ **No browser opens when running for Electron**  
✅ **Clean separation of concerns**  
✅ **Follows Bazel best practices**  
✅ **Ready for development and distribution**  

The implementation successfully combines Graham Jenson's Bazel-centric approach with modern development workflows, creating a maintainable solution for running Gazel as both a web app and desktop application.
