# Electron Integration Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Created Electron App Directory Structure
- Moved all Electron configuration to `electron-app/` directory
- Created BUILD.bazel file for Bazel integration
- Separated concerns between web and desktop builds

### 2. Bazel Integration Attempt
- Created BUILD.bazel with js_binary rules for Electron targets
- Implemented wrapper scripts to bridge Bazel and Electron Forge
- Encountered challenges with Bazel's sandboxed environment

### 3. Key Learnings

#### Challenges with Current Approach
- **Sandbox Issues**: Bazel's sandboxed environment makes it difficult for Electron Forge to find dependencies
- **Module Resolution**: Complex interactions between ES modules, CommonJS, and Bazel's runfiles
- **Path Issues**: Electron Forge expects a traditional node_modules structure that Bazel doesn't provide

#### Graham Jenson's Approach (from bazel-electron repo)
Based on the article "Building an Electron App with Bazel", a simpler approach:

1. **Download Electron Binary**: Use `http_file` to download pre-built Electron
2. **Bundle with Go**: Use a Go program to package app files into Electron
3. **Custom Bazel Rule**: Create `electron_app` rule for building
4. **No npm in Bazel**: Avoid complex node_modules handling

## Current Status

### What Works
✅ Electron app runs successfully outside of Bazel (via npm in electron-app directory)
✅ Bazel continues to work for web builds
✅ Clean separation of Electron config in `electron-app/` directory
✅ All source files properly organized

### What Needs Work
⚠️ Bazel integration with Electron Forge has dependency resolution issues
⚠️ Wrapper scripts need refinement for Bazel's sandbox environment

## Recommended Next Steps

### Option 1: Simple npm Scripts (Quick Solution)
Keep Electron separate from Bazel and use npm scripts:
```bash
cd electron-app && npm install && npm start
```

### Option 2: Implement Graham Jenson's Approach (Proper Bazel Integration)
1. Add Electron binary download to WORKSPACE
2. Create a simple bundler (Go or Python)
3. Define custom `electron_app` Bazel rule
4. Bundle app into self-contained executable

### Option 3: Use Bazel for Building, npm for Running
1. Use Bazel to compile TypeScript and bundle assets
2. Copy built files to electron-app
3. Run Electron via npm scripts

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `electron-app/BUILD.bazel` - Bazel build configuration
- `electron-app/package.json` - Electron-specific dependencies
- `electron-app/forge.config.cjs` - Electron Forge configuration
- `electron-app/vite.*.config.mjs` - Vite configurations
- `electron-app/electron-forge-wrapper.mjs` - Wrapper for Bazel
- `electron-app/electron-launcher.mjs` - Direct launcher
- `electron-app/README.md` - Documentation

### Modified Files
- `package.json` - Updated scripts to use Bazel commands
- `BUILD.bazel` - Added exports for Electron files
- `electron/main.ts` - Removed unused import

## Conclusion

While full Bazel integration with Electron Forge proved challenging due to sandbox and dependency resolution issues, we successfully:
1. Organized the Electron configuration in a dedicated directory
2. Maintained separation between web and desktop builds
3. Identified a proven approach (Graham Jenson's) for proper Bazel integration

The current setup allows for parallel development of both web (via Bazel) and desktop (via npm) applications while sharing the same source code.
