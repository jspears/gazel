# GitHub Actions Workflows

This directory contains automated workflows for building and distributing Gazel.

## Available Workflows

### üçé Build and Sign macOS App
**File**: `workflows/build-macos.yml`

Automatically builds, signs, and notarizes the macOS Electron app.

**Triggers:**
- Push to `main` or `master` branch
- Pull requests (build only, no signing)
- Version tags (e.g., `v1.0.0`) - creates GitHub releases
- Manual workflow dispatch

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Sets up macOS runner with Node.js and pnpm
2. ‚úÖ Imports your Developer ID certificate
3. ‚úÖ Configures Apple API key for notarization
4. ‚úÖ Builds the Electron app
5. ‚úÖ Signs the app with your Developer ID
6. ‚úÖ Notarizes with Apple (2-10 minutes)
7. ‚úÖ Creates distributable installers (ZIP/DMG)
8. ‚úÖ Uploads artifacts (available for 30 days)
9. ‚úÖ Creates GitHub releases for version tags

**Artifacts produced:**
- `Gazel-macOS-app` - Signed .app bundle
- `Gazel-macOS-installer` - Signed and notarized installer

## Setup Instructions

### First-Time Setup

1. **Read the setup guide**: [GITHUB_ACTIONS_SIGNING.md](../GITHUB_ACTIONS_SIGNING.md)
2. **Follow the checklist**: [SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md](SECRETS_CHECKLIST.md)
3. **Add 5 required secrets** to your GitHub repository:
   - `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_BASE64`
   - `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_BASE64`
   - `APPLE_API_KEY_ID`
   - `APPLE_API_ISSUER`

### Quick Start

After setup, the workflow runs automatically. To create a release:

```bash
# Tag your version
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0

# The workflow will:
# - Build and sign the app
# - Notarize with Apple
# - Create a GitHub release
# - Attach the signed installer
```

## Testing the Workflow

### Test Build (No Release)
```bash
# Push to main to trigger a build
git push origin main

# Or manually trigger from GitHub:
# Actions ‚Üí Build and Sign macOS App ‚Üí Run workflow
```

### Test Release
```bash
# Create a test tag
git tag v0.0.1-test
git push origin v0.0.1-test

# Check the Actions tab for progress
# Check the Releases page for the created release
```

## Monitoring Builds

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. Click on a workflow run to see details
3. Expand each step to view logs
4. Download artifacts from the workflow summary page

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "Certificate not found"
- Verify `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_BASE64` is correctly encoded
- Check `APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` is correct
- Ensure you exported the full certificate (not just public key)

### Build fails with "Notarization failed"
- Check API key permissions in App Store Connect
- Verify `APPLE_API_KEY_ID` and `APPLE_API_ISSUER` are correct
- Review workflow logs for specific Apple error messages

### Secrets not working
- Verify all 5 secrets are added (Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions)
- Check secret names match exactly (case-sensitive)
- Re-encode and re-add secrets if needed

## Security

- ‚úÖ All secrets are encrypted by GitHub
- ‚úÖ Secrets are never exposed in logs
- ‚úÖ Temporary keychain is created and deleted for each build
- ‚úÖ Sensitive files are cleaned up after build
- ‚úÖ Only repository admins can view/edit secrets

## Cost

- **GitHub Actions**: Free for public repositories
- **Private repositories**: Included minutes vary by plan
- **macOS runners**: ~10x multiplier on minutes (e.g., 10 minutes = 100 minutes used)
- **Typical build time**: 10-15 minutes (including notarization)

## Customization

### Change trigger branches
Edit `workflows/build-macos.yml`:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
      - develop  # Add more branches
```

### Add scheduled builds
```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 0 * * 0'  # Weekly on Sunday
```

### Modify artifact retention
```yaml
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    retention-days: 90  # Change from 30 to 90 days
```
